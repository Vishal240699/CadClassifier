The project was done as the first step towards Neural Networks.
The main files are main_basic_cnn.py and main_vgg16.py.

main_basic_cnn is a basic CNN model with acuuracy of around 80%.

VGG16 uses transfer learning. Transfer learning is a technique in machine learning where a model trained
for a certain task is modified to make predictions for another task.
This model (i.e. main_vgg16.py) achieves accuracy as close as 90%.
